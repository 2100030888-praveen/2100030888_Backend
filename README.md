I have documented the details of the output achieved by connecting to Django in the "SAFERTEK_BACKEND_BY_DJANGO.docx" file.
Additionally, I have provided a comprehensive overview of SQL queries along with all the output screenshots in the "SQl_Queries_with_all_ouput_screenshots.docx" file.
Furthermore, the "backend" folder contains the backend connection implementation from MySQL using Django.
